# TeamgymDelayApp â€“ Real-Time Video Delay App for Gymnastics Training

> A simple yet powerful application for real-time performance analysis through adjustable video delay. Originally built for artistic gymnastics and TeamGym, but adaptable to any sport.

## Objective

Allow gymnasts to **visualize their jumps and movements with adjustable delay**, using a camera connected to a locally running system. A web interface provides easy control over delay settings and system state.

This project was born out of a practical need during TeamGym training, where **immediate visual feedback** is essential to correct technique and improve performance.

## How It Works

1. A camera streams live video into a Python-based system  
2. A **circular buffer** stores the last N seconds of frames  
3. Delay is controlled through a simple web interface  
4. The delayed video is displayed on a second monitor/screen  
5. The frontend sends commands to the backend (.NET), which communicates with the Python system
